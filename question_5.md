<p>I will mention my friend Niketan. who will be one of my partner. And another one is my friend tejesh who is a high IQ person.
Why I choose Niketan, we both share our knowledge and try to improve ourselves every time we met. 
All this started with a hackathon, where we build a basic Website with frontend and backend and submitted it for the hackathon.
And got know that, we need to learn a lot. We started web dev and now me and my friend Niketan MERN stack developer. 
Recently He got an internship in spacex100 which is a startup company. If we both are together there is nothing that can't be solved.
Coming Tejesh, He is a well-focused person. If he enters into any field, he definitely cracks that thing in a single go.</p>
