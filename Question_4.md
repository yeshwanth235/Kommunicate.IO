My best project is Api Market Place which is a react-based application.
Where I Register for a Hands-on Project with Cuvette tech which is for 4 weeks.
Here I have to create a project called Api Market Place.
In week 1 the Cuvette team gave me the front design of the application. And told me
to build the application totally by myself.<br>
<p>In my first project, where I started from scratch and build every component
needed and madeÂ my hands dirty. And learned a lot of new stuff, finally done with my frontend part for a few pages.</p> 
<p>Here Comes the 2nd week, they have API's for signup and connect it with my application. It went well, I finally connected it with the front end.</p>
<p>Week 3: In this week they told us to have a back remover API. which removes the background of the image when it is uploaded by the user and the user can download that image with no background.
The team provided us with documentation to create an API. But week 3 was hell to me.</p>
<p>Week 4: It goes with adding a form to the application to store other API provided by users.
And show all the API on the main page.</p>

<p>Throughout this program, I get to know what I learned through my udemy courses and how I am using it to build an application.
And I also become familiar with react-redux, styled-components, and creating different Apis in the backend.Finally got know that wed dev is nothing but learn by doing.</p>
